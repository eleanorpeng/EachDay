## About
Each Day is an app that allows users to record life events, whether significant or minute, via a simple journal. Simultaneously, users can track their time spent each day and reflect with a pie chart. 

## Motivation
We live only once. To make the best out of life, I believe it's important to aim to become a better person by cautiously planning out how we spend our time each day and recording the best memories everyday. Each day is unique and exciting, and I hope this app could become a tool to assist people on achieving their own goals or dream life.  

## Features
* **Time Capsule** <br />
 Ever wanted to say something to your future-self? Select a time and send some encouragement to you with our unlimited time caps!
* **Time Tracker Summary** <br />
  Quick and easy way to aggregate your tracked time for each day, week, or month in a pie chart. Clean and comprehensive data provided for you to reflect on your productivity at a breeze.
* **Passcode/FaceID** <br />
  Don’t want other people to read your diary? Rest assured. Secure your data with passcode and FaceID/TouchID and write freely in Each Day.
* **Customizable Theme** <br />
  If you’re feeling different each month, change the theme color for that month’s card! Up to 15 colors are available, and more colors are coming soon in the future.
